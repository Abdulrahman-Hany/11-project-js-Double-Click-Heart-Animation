# Double Click Heart Animation

This project demonstrates a simple double-click heart animation built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. When the user double-clicks inside the container, a heart icon appears at the click position and fades away after a short duration.

## Features

- **Double Click Animation**: A heart icon appears at the exact location of the double-click within the container.
- **Smooth Disappearance**: The heart fades away after appearing, providing a smooth user experience.
- **Positioning Based on Click**: The heart icon is dynamically positioned based on where the user double-clicks.

## How It Works

1. A container is provided where users can double-click.
2. When a double-click is detected, the heart icon appears at the location of the click inside the container.
3. The heart remains visible for a short duration before disappearing automatically.
4. The animation is triggered every time a double-click occurs in the container.
